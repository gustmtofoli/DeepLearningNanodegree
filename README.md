## Deep Learning Nanodegree

This is a repo containing my progress in the Udacity Nanodegree: Deep Learning.

## Projects

- Bike Sharing: 
  - implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (without libs/frameworks) to predict bike sharing usage based on previous years usage data.

- Dog Breed: 
  - implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network with Pytorch to predict and detect dog breeds from an image.
  - impementation of a [transfer learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-hands-on-guide-to-transfer-learning-with-real-world-applications-in-deep-learning-212bf3b2f27a) model to predict dog breeds from an image.
  - Detect human faces and predict the dog breed that best fits the face in the image.
